# PHP WebSocket Chat Application

This repository contains a simple chat application using WebSockets in PHP. The application enables real-time messaging between clients connected through a WebSocket server. Messages sent by clients are stored directly in files without the need for a database. This README provides an overview of the application and instructions for setting it up and running it.

## Features

- Real-time bi-directional communication between server and clients using WebSockets.
- Text messages are stored in files, each connection having its own log file.
- No database required, simplifying setup and reducing dependencies.
- Simple and lightweight design, suitable for understanding the basics of WebSockets in PHP.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher.
- Composer for managing PHP dependencies.
- A web server (like Apache or Nginx) capable of serving PHP.
- Web browser with support for JavaScript and WebSockets.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/oleh-k/php_websocket.git
cd php_websocket


2. **Install Dependencies**
composer install


3. **Run the WebSocket Server**
php websocket_server.php

This will start the WebSocket server on `localhost:8080`.

## Usage

1. **Open the Client Interface**
- Navigate to the `index.html` file in your web browser to open the chat interface.

2. **Connect to the WebSocket Server**
- The client interface should automatically connect to the WebSocket server.

3. **Chatting**
- Enter your message in the input field and press Send. The message will be transmitted to the server and stored in a file.

## File Storage

- Messages are stored in text files within the project directory.
- Each client connection generates a new file with the naming convention `message_{resourceId}.txt`, where `{resourceId}` is the unique identifier of the WebSocket connection.
